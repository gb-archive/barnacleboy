## What is Barnacleboy?
Barnacleboy is an emulator for the original Nintendo(c) Gameboy(tm)
also known as the DMG Gameboy in specification sheets. The goal of this
emulator is to emulate the original Gameboy hardware as accurately as
possible and learn along the way!

For those wondering about the name, here's the process I went through
when deciding on it:

Rust -> users are called Rustaceans -> play on crustacean
-> what other crustaceans are there other than crabs? ->
Barnacles -> merge with Gameboy and blam, you got yourself the name
Barnacleboy

## Another GB Emulator? Why?
Hardware emulation has been a topic of my interest for quite a long time
and is something I find very exciting to see happen. After watching a lot
of [yupferris](https://github.com/yupferris)'s Rustendo64 streams, I thought
that emulating a simpler piece of hardware would be a great experience for
learning a lot more about Rust while also giving myself a project to work on
in the long term.

tl;dr: because I can. :)

## Why Rust?
I chose to write Barnacleboy in Rust because its been the first programming
language that I've gotten quite excited in the past few years. I think the
combination of a younger systems language that tries to improve on the issues
of the last many years in a fairly unqiue way really piqued my interest in 
the language. The fact that it is memory safe helps to ensure there are as 
many minimal issues with that as possible and I think will help the project
quite a bit.

## Thinking About Contributing?
Awesome! The project is still in its infancy stage, so a lot of work needs
to be done. If you're interested in contributing to the project, feel free
to submit an issue or even a pull-request if you find [something isn't quite
right](https://i.imgur.com/18BUBPf.jpg) or shoot me a message on Discord 
(you can find me in the [Rust Discord](https://discord.gg/23sA8nR))
